                <p>Mental health refers to your overall emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how you think, feel, and act — and plays a role in how you handle stress, relate to others, and make choices every day.</p>
                <p>Good mental health does not mean the absence of problems. It means having the tools and support to cope with life's challenges in a healthy way.</p>
                <div class="info-box">
                    Mental health matters just as much as physical health. Seeking support is a sign of strength, not weakness.

                <h3>Anxiety</h3>
                <p>Anxiety is an excessive worry or fear about everyday situations. It can show up as racing thoughts, muscle tension, or difficulty sleeping. Treatment often involves therapy, coping techniques, and sometimes medication.</p>

                <h3>Depression</h3>
                <p>Depression is more than sadness — it is a persistent feeling of emptiness or hopelessness that affects your ability to function. A professional can help you work through it with the right support plan.</p>

                <h3>Stress</h3>
                <p>Everyone experiences stress, but when it becomes overwhelming or long-lasting it can affect your health. Learning to manage stress through regular routines, exercise, and talking to someone is key.</p>

                    If you recognise signs of any of these conditions in yourself, our mental health professionals on Better Space are here to help. Use the search page to find someone in your area of need.

                <h3>Deep Breathing</h3>
                <p>Slow, deep breaths activate your body's relaxation response. Try breathing in for 4 counts, holding for 4, and out for 6. Repeat several times when you feel overwhelmed.</p>

                <h3>Regular Exercise</h3>
                <p>Even a short walk can reduce stress hormones and boost your mood. Aim for at least 20–30 minutes of movement each day.</p>

                <h3>Healthy Sleep</h3>
                <p>Sleep is when your mind recovers. Keep a consistent schedule, limit screens before bed, and create a calm environment.</p>

                <h3>Talk to Someone</h3>
                <p>Sharing how you feel — with a friend, family member, or professional — can lighten the weight you carry. You do not have to do it alone.</p>

                <h3>Journalling</h3>
                <p>Writing down your thoughts helps you process emotions and spot patterns in your mood over time.</p>
